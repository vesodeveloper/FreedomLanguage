# Web IDE
We developed Web integrated development environment using HTML,CSS & JavaScript
because of we want to make it available on every platform and OS -> 
Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux, Android,IOS.

# How to use the IDE
The integrated development environment contains 2 main parts: 
Text field  for the source code and letters of the English alphabet. 
When mousepointer is on each letter the sound for every letter is playing. 
When the user click on any letter the JavaScript intelisence autocomplete menu 
is shown, then when the mousepointer is on the menu the user can hear the 
keywords and when the keyword is clicked on the text area value is the 
programming statement.
Firstly there are Cut,Copy,Paste and Delete buttons.
Next is the field where the user can write the file name.
Under the source code  text field there are buttons
for reading the current value of the field,
for saving  the current value of the field as .free file.
On the next coloum is the field for open file name
and bellow is the button for .free files Viewer
